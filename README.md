1. in sidebar the conversation are not immeditately displyed when a new message is sent or even after chosing a new chat again, the conversation is displayed only after refreshing the page.

2. for normal  questions like "Who are you?" ,  the reply like below 
     "I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information from the course videos to answer that question.  While several transcripts contain mentions of personal pronouns like "I" and "you," none directly and explicitly address the question "Who are you?" in a way that would allow me to pinpoint a specific location within a video."
     also its provide some randow video link of that course which is not related to the question asked.

     solution: Its should be to give this basic question answer which are not related to any video but can provide like " Hi, I am a virtual assistant designed to help students with their coursework in Sigma Web develpment course. If you have any questions about the course like if want to find a particular is taught in which video then i will try my best to find it out for you. Thank You."

     and do not provide video links as well for this type of basic general questions.

3. not properly responsive on mobile devices, Sepcially for sidebar , should be hide while conversation box is open. and give user option to show/hide sidebar.
